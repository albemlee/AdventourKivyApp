Fisher Mansion,https://www.iskcondetroit.com/about-us/what-is-iskcon/,"The International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON), otherwise known as the Hare Krishna movement, includes five hundred major centers, temples and rural communities, nearly one hundred affilated vegetarian restaurants, thousands of namahattas or local meeting groups, a wide variety of community projects, and millions of congregational members worldwide. Although less than fifty years on the global stage, ISKCON has expanded widely since its founding by His Divine Grace A. C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhup_da in New York City in 1966.

ISKCON belongs to the Gaudiya-Vaishnava samprad_ya, a monotheistic tradition within the Vedic or Hindu culture. Philosophically it is based on the Sanskrit texts Bhagavad-g_t_ and the Bhagavat Purana, or Srimad Bhagavatam. These are the historic texts of the devotional bhakti yoga tradition, which teaches that the ultimate goal for all living beings is to reawaken their love for God, or Lord Krishna, the “all-attractive one”.

God is known across the world by many names including Allah, Jehovah, Yahweh, Rama, etc. ISKCON devotees chant God’s names in the form of the maha-mantra, or the great prayer for deliverance: Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare.

Many leading academics have highlighted ISKCON’s authenticity. Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at Harvard University, describes the movement as “a tradition that commands a respected place in the religious life of humankind.” In the 1980s Dr. A. L. Basham, one of the world’s authorities on Indian history and culture, wrote of ISKCON that, “It arose out of next to nothing in less than twenty years and has become known all over the West. This, I feel, is a sign of the times and an important fact in the history of the Western world.”

What is ISKCONISKCON’s founder, Srila Prabhupada, has drawn appreciation from scholars and religious leaders alike for his remarkable achievement in presenting India’s Vaishnava spiritual culture in a relevant manner to contemporary Western and worldwide audiences.

Members of ISKCON practice bhakti-yoga in their homes and also worship in temples. They also promote bhakti-yoga, or Krishna Consciousness, through festivals, the performing arts, yoga seminars, public chanting, and the distribution of the society’s literatures. ISKCON members have also opened hospitals, schools, colleges, eco-villages, free food distribution projects, and other institutions as a practical application of the path of devotional yoga.",,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/an20cc2QPqNBAfeyz4XKnxh85ZU=/0x0:3000x2000/1820x1213/filters:focal(1260x760:1740x1240):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59405583/Fisher-232.0.0.jpg
PuppetART Theater,https://www.puppetart.org/puppetart-center/,"PUPPETS, they laugh, they dance, they cry, they sing, they talk. THEY TELL!
They come in countless sizes and shapes. They’re controlled by many different means -from string and rods to bare hands.   However, while every puppet is a unique object, designed by an artist, they all share in the depth of their feelings, happiness and struggles. Their stories are the most complete record of our history.
Our VISION is to become a center for puppetry activities in SE Michigan, a valuable member of the area's artistic  community, an important part in the aesthetic education of area youth, and a significant  influence upon cultural development in metropolitan Detroit.
Puppetry is found in every culture throughout the world. It has a long history that dates back thousands of years. From the dawn of human memory puppetry has been a story-teller and entertainer; a way to speak to gods and to pass down the wisdom and traditions of people through generations. Every puppet show is a home for all art forms: two-dimensional background, three-dimensional puppets, music, dancing, singing and literature – any story, be it poetry or political satire, all art forms found home in every puppet show.",,https://media-cdn.tripadvisor.com/media/photo-s/0c/2a/1c/66/puppet-art-theater-downtown.jpg
